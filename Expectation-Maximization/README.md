# Expectation - Maximization for Gaussian Mixtures

Example of the algorithm: 
- Given a data-set generated by two gaussians, estimate using K=2 the parameters which maximize the log-likelihood.
The pictures show how the algorithm can get stuck in a local minimum (otherwise, this would be the holy grial)
